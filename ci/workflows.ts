/**
 * The repo's CI/CD, in TypeScript. `bun run workflows` renders this file to
 * `.github/workflows/*.yml`; never edit the YAML by hand (CI checks it matches).
 *
 * Two workflows:
 *
 *   ci.yml       every PR and every push to master — one `check` job (format,
 *                lint, typecheck, build, package health, this
 *                file's YAML being in sync), then a Vercel deploy: a preview
 *                URL commented on the PR, production on master.
 *
 *   release.yml  manual button (Actions → Release → Run workflow). Bumps
 *                0.0.1-N → N+1, publishes to npm, pushes the version commit and
 *                deploys production. The CI-side equivalent of `bun run prod`.
 *
 * Both run on Blacksmith runners, which are a drop-in `runs-on` swap: the cache
 * actions and everything else stay stock.
 *
 * npm needs no token at all: the release publishes over OIDC (trusted
 * publishing), configured against this repo + `release.yml` on npmjs.com.
 *
 * Secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
 *   VERCEL_TOKEN      vercel.com/account/tokens
 *   VERCEL_ORG_ID     `orgId` from .vercel/project.json (gitignored)
 *   VERCEL_PROJECT_ID `projectId` from .vercel/project.json
